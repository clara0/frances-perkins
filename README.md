# frances-perkins
A website proposing the creation of Frances Perkins Day to honor Perkins, an advocate for workers' rights. 

Frances Perkins Day would take place on March 4th, the day she was sworn in as the Secretary of Labor in 1993 as part of President Theodore Roosevelt's cabinet. As Secretary of Labor, Perkins was able to accomplish many of her reform goals and made tremendous progress in workers' rights. In fact, her impact in the government has defined many rights for workers today, such as a minimum wage and social security.
