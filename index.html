            Frances Perkins strove to improve working conditions and increase wages, particularly for women. She also
            wanted to implement a minimum wage as well as a maximum workweek to cap the number of hours women and children
            could work in a week. After the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in which many young women died, she began to
            fight for improved fire safety as well. Throughout her career, she fought to end child labor and improve
            insurance for the unemployed. She also helped develop a social security policy to provide retired people with
            an income.

    <!--Her achievements with reforms-->
    <h2 class="subtitle" id="achievements">Her Achievements</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Frances Perkins was able to successfully achieve a variety of reforms that she tirelessly worked towards,
            including a minimum wage, maximum workweek, and better working conditions for women and children. One of
            her earlier achievements was the passage of the 54-hour bill after extensive lobbying, which would limit
            the workweek of women and children to fifty-four hours a week. After being appointed the secretary of labor
            by President Theodore Roosevelt, she was key in the creation of the Social Security Act and Fair Labor
            Standards Act. The Social Security Act created a program that provided regular payments for retired people
            above sixty-five years old. The Fair Labor Standards Act established a starting minimum wage of twenty-five
            cents an hour, and required that wage to be increased to forty cents an hour within the next seven years.
            It also dictated that no person should be required to work more than forty-four hours a week the first year
            of employment, forty-two hours a week the second year, and forty hours a week for all other years without
            overtime pay.

    <!--Her impact on the US today-->
    <h2 class="subtitle" id="impact">Her Impact on Work Today</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            While Frances Perkins is often overshadowed by other reformers from the Progressive Era, the accomplishments
            she made during her lifetime still affect our daily lives today. Her position and status in Roosevelt’s
            cabinet has paved the way for more women to enter politics and other fields of study previously believed
            only men could undertake. The reforms she lobbied for, such as a maximum number of hours one can work
            without overtime pay, a shortened number of hours one can work, and improved working conditions greatly
            enhanced worker’s livelihoods. The Fair Labor Standards Act established a minimum wage that still exists
            today, so even those who work menial jobs still make enough to earn a living. It also set a maximum work
            week of forty hours, which is still in use today and there is still a minimum working age today. The Social
            Security Act enables those who are retired and unable to work to earn enough money to continue living
            relatively comfortably, and still supports them. Many of the reforms that Perkins advocated for are still
            relevant to work today and as the first female cabinet member, she set a precedent for the role of women in
            politics.
